# 100 Days Of Code - Log

##Plan
**Day 1 -  Day 10:** Review the core JS and Client-side JS

### Day 1:  Jan 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Continue reading "JavaScript: the definitive guide". Spent 4 hours raeding Chapter 9, classes and Modules. Fished half. Stopped before Pg.220, Standard Vonversion Method. Started to code in JS again since last September, even though it's about moving codes from book to the local file system. 

**Thoughts:** Without reading this chapter, I probably would forgot that there're classes in JavaScript. It's interesting to know how to use JavaScript to write Java-style Classes. It's also interesting to see how to practice with the Object-oriented programming by using JS.

### Day 2:  Jan 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reading a book called "HTML&CSS design and build websites", written by Jon Duckett. It's the third time that I have read this book in order to prepare myself for the front end of web development. Today, I reviewed HTML and HTML5, and I also practiced on HTML/HTML5 form controls.

**Thoughts:** Don't be afraid of forgetting something. Learning takes time.

### Day 3:  Jan 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continue reading a book called "HTML&CSS design and build websites", written by Jon Duckett. In addition to learning the rest content of HTML, I also reviewed some part of CSS. I learned what is Flash movie and video/audio players. I practiced on adding flash movie, video and audio to the webpage, and tested them by using Chrome and Firefox. 

**Thoughts:** The flash video player that I use to play the .flv video doesn't work out in both Chrome and Firefox. I'm still confused about what's the difference between Adobe flash player and other flash players. What should I put in a html file in order to use the Adobe Flash player to play FLV files, as Adobe Flash player is plugged in most modern browsers.

### Day 4:  Jan 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refresh what I previously learned about the Core JS. Still learned something new. Write simple statements on the browser console, in order to test tricky parts like unicode escape sequences, even though they seem to be easily forgotton in the near future.

**Thoughts:** Learning is never like a linear process. I need to repeat refreshing my memory.

### Day 5: Jan 7-8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Definitely put more effort than yesterday. Still did some review about the Core JS. Today's review topic is about "value, type and variable". Insprired by the Math object functions, I decided to create a Calcular by making use of these functions and also recall data structures. So I did some review about stack and then implemented the stack by using JS classes, which I learned on Jan 3. 

**Thoughts:** I learned and practiced with Data Structures and Algorithms in the summer, 2016. Although I practiced on over 100 problems, I still don't have a clear picture about the implementation of Stack. Today, I overcomed the discouragement of reviewing data structures, and learned how to implement Stack by myself. I feel proud of it, especially about the fact that writing the Object-oriented style of code comes to be so fluent when I use JS.

## Day 6: Jan 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Expand yester's project to build a simple calculator.

**Thoughts:** Need more practices with data stracture and algorithms.

## Day 7: Jan 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Created an enumeartion class. Replace stack with Array functions like push() and pop(). Update my calculator. Review Array's built-in functions.

**Thoughts:** JavaScript class is so flexiable to use. It's cool that a function is both an object and also a class by itself. Implementing the idea of Enumeration makes me learn alot. If it's not because of my reviewing of Array's functions, I won't remember that Array has push() and pop() functions that make arrays act like stacks.

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
