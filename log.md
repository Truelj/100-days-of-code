# 100 Days Of Code - Log

##Plan
**Day 0 -  Day 9:** Review the core JS and Client-side JS

### Day 0:  Jan 3, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Continue reading "JavaScript: the definitive guide". Spent 4 hours raeding Chapter 9, classes and Modules. Fished half. Stopped before Pg.220, Standard Vonversion Method. Started to code in JS again since last September, even though it's about moving codes from book to the local file system. 

**Thoughts:** Without reading this chapter, I probably would forgot that there're classes in JavaScript. It's interesting to know how to use JavaScript to write Java-style Classes. It's also interesting to see how to practice with the Object-oriented programming by using JS. 

**Link to work:** [How to define a class in JS](https://github.com/Truelj/Start_web/tree/master/JavaScript%20study/Javascript-the%20def%20guide/Core%20js/Classes%20and%20Modules)

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
